            Parkinson’s disease also known a-synucleinopathy, is a progressive
            neurodegenerative disease. There are five stages of Parkinson’s
            disease. Stage 1 and 2 are the early stages. Stage 2 and 3 are the
            mid-stages, and Stage 4 and 5 are the advanced stages. In stage 1,
            the person has mild symptoms that never really interfere with their
            daily activities. In this stage, there might be changes in posture,
            walking and facial expressions. In stage 2, the symptoms start
            getting worse. Movement symptoms can affect a person on both sides
            of the body and also the neck. The person will have problems with
            walking and they will have poor posture. Doing daily tasks are more
            difficult and lengthier. In stage 3, people could experience a loss
            of balance and falls are way more common. Motor symptoms get worse.
            It’s really hard for a person to do their daily tasks now. However,
            they are still capable of living an independent life. In stage 4,
            symptoms are fully developed. The person is still able to walk and
            stand without any assistance. However, they might a cane or walking
            stick to be safe. This person also needs help to complete daily
            tasks and are unable to live alone. In stage 5, the stiffness in a
            persons leg makes it impossible to stand or walk. The person needs a
            wheelchair to roam around and they need someone to help them with
            every activity they do. Those are all of the stages of Parkinson’s
            disease. As you can see, the symptoms get worse within every stage
            and it gets more difficult to do everyday tasks.
