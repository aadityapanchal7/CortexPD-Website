            About 15% of people with Parkinson’s disease have a family history
            of the condition. Family-linked Parkinson’s disease cases can result
            from genetic mutations in a group of genes. There are five major
            genes that are known to contribute to Parkinson’s disease. These
            genes are SNCA, PARK2, PARK7, PINK1, and LRRK2. SNCA makes a protein
            called alpha-synuclein. In brain cells of individuals with
            Parkinson’s disease, alpha-synuclein gathers in clumps. These clumps
            are called Lewy bodies. These clumps cause Parkinson’s disease
            symptoms. Mutations in the SNCA gene occur in early-onset
            Parkinson’s disease. The PARK2 gene makes the protein parkin, which
            normally helps cells break down and recycle proteins. Mutations in
            this gene cause a rare form of early-onset Parkinson’s disease. The
            PARK7 gene makes a protein called DJ-1. DJ-1 protects against
            mitochondrial stress. The protein made by PINK1 is a protein kinase.
            Kinase is a an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate
            group to a specified molecule. Kinase protects mitochondria.
            Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell and the structure inside
            the cell. PINK1 mutations occur in early-onset Parkinson’s disease.
            The protein made by LRRK2 is also a protein kinase. Mutations in the
            LRRK2 gene have been linked to late-onset Parkinson’s disease. Among
            inherited cases of Parkinson’s, the inheritance patterns differ
            depending on the genes involved. If the LRRK2 or SNCA genes are
            involved, Parkinson’s is most likely inherited from just one parent.
            That is called an autosomal dominant pattern. An autosomal dominant
            pattern is when you only need one copy of a gene to be altered for
            the disorder to happen. If the PARK2, PARK7 or PINK1 gene is
            involved, it’s typically in an autosomal recessive pattern. An
            autosomal recessive pattern is when you need two copies of the gene
            altered for the disorder to happen. That means that two copies of
            the gene in each cell have been altered. Both parents passed on the
            altered gene but may not have had any signs of Parkinson’s disease
            themselves. It’s still unknown if there are any other genes,
            mutations, and factors that can cause Parkinson’s disease but maybe
            one day we will find out the answer.
