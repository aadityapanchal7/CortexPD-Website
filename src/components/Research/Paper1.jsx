          Parkinson’s disease also known as a-synucleinopathy, is a progressive
            neurodegenerative disease (destruction of specific nerve cells).
            Parkinson's restricts patient movement rendering them incapacitated
            during many periods throughout the day. This causes symptoms to get
            worse over time. Unfortunately, there is no cure for Parkinson’s
            disease. A protein called a-synuclein which is a water-soluble protein
            that lacks a three-dimensional structure, becomes an mis fold. This
            specific protein aggregates (meaning multiple things combining into
            one whole thing). These aggregations are also known as Lewy bodies.
            These Lewy bodies are laid down which causes nerve cells to damage and
            die. This happens to specific areas in the brain and body. This causes
            Parkinson’s disease to form. The most affected area of the brain is
            the substantia nigra. This is an area deep inside the brain which has
            a high percentage of dopamine nerve cells. This area is also crucial
            for dopamine production. Dopamine is a compound in the human body. It
            is a neurotransmitter. This causes dopamine to interfere with
            signaling. This changes a person’s movement and balance leading to
            Parkinson’s disease.
